/**
 * Playwright configuration (PR15).
 *
 * Design decisions and why:
 *  - PRODUCTION PREVIEW, not the dev server. `vite preview` serves the real build, so
 *    there is no HMR race and no on-demand transform latency, and the artifact under
 *    test is the one users get.
 *  - 127.0.0.1, not localhost — avoids IPv4/IPv6 resolution races.
 *  - A per-worktree derived port (see `worktreePort` below), isolated from dev
 *    (4000) and the other app on this machine (3000).
 *    `--strictPort` makes a collision a loud failure instead of a silent reassignment.
 *  - workers: 1. There is exactly one WebGL context and one WASM solver instance per
 *    page; serialising keeps timing and GPU behaviour deterministic.
 *  - SwiftShader software GL so rendering is identical on a laptop and on a CI runner.
 *  - Chromium only for the first landing (it is the only browser cached locally and
 *    the least fragile for Three.js/WebGL). Firefox/WebKit are a follow-up.
 *
 * Local commands:
 *   npm run test:e2e:install     # one-time: fetch the Chromium build
 *   npm run test:e2e:smoke       # blocking suite (fast, runs on every PR)
 *   npm run test:e2e:slow        # heavy suite (408-member model, screenshots)
 *   npm run test:e2e:ui          # interactive runner
 *   npm run test:e2e:update-snapshots

const HOST = '127.0.0.1';
/*
 * A port of this worktree's own, derived from its path.
 *
 * 4173 is Vite's default preview port, so every worktree of this repo claims
 * it, and with `reuseExistingServer` on locally a run silently attaches to
 * whichever one got there first. It then tests a DIFFERENT BRANCH'S BUILD and
 * reports the differences as failures in yours — a ribbon missing the commands
 * your branch added reads as "the feature is broken", not as "wrong bundle".
 * The failure is entirely convincing, which is what makes it expensive: it has
 * cost this project an afternoon of chasing defects that were not there.
 *
 * A comment saying "set E2E_PORT" was here before and did not prevent it,
 * because the person who needs the warning is the one who does not know yet
 * that they are on a shared port. So the default no longer collides: it is
 * derived from the worktree's own directory, which is different for every
 * checkout by construction. E2E_PORT still overrides, for CI or for pinning.

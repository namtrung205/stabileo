/**
 * Write real HTML for every public route, so the site can be indexed.
 *
 * ── The problem this exists for ──
 *
 * GitHub Pages serves files. `dist/` held exactly two — index.html and
 * 404.html — so every address except the homepage answered **404** to anyone
 * who asked, and 404.html bounced browsers to `/?route=…` where JavaScript
 * drew the page. A person never noticed. A crawler got a 404 and dropped the
 * URL, which is why `/demo` has been live for months and indexed never. And
 * the homepage, which does answer 200, answered it with zero characters of
 * text: an empty shell that only becomes a page once a script runs.
 *
 * After this, `dist/es/blog/x/index.html` exists, Pages answers 200, and the
 * text is in the file.
 *
 * ── Why a browser and not a template ──
 *
 * The obvious alternative is to render the markup from the post data with a
 * small template. It would be faster and it would be a second implementation
 * of every page — one that drifts from the Svelte components the moment
 * anyone edits them, silently, because nothing compares the two. Driving the
 * real application means the captured HTML is by construction the page we
 * ship. Playwright is already a dev dependency, so this costs no new one.
 *
 * ── Why the markup is not hydrated ──
 *
 * It is captured from a running browser, so it carries none of the anchors
 * Svelte's hydration needs. It goes into `<div id="prerender">`, outside
 * `#app`, and main.ts removes it before mounting. A crawler reads it; a
 * browser sees it for one paint and then the application takes over with its
 * own render. The prerender is a photograph for machines, never a second
 * implementation.
 *
 * Usage (runs as part of `npm run build`):
 *   npx tsx scripts/prerender.ts

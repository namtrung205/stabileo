/**
 * Every language the public landing offers actually speaks the whole page.
 *
 * The landing offers the locales in PUBLIC_LOCALES (src/lib/i18n/store.ts)
 * and nothing else. `t()` falls back to English silently, so a missing key
 * renders an English sentence in the middle of a Spanish or Portuguese page and
 * nothing errors. That is precisely the defect this guards — and the reason the
 * list of offered locales and this test have to move together: adding a locale
 * to PUBLIC_LOCALES without its copy fails here rather than shipping a page
 * that switches language halfway down.
 *
 * Scope is derived from the source, not from a hand-maintained list: the test
 * scans every landing component for `t('landing.…')` and requires each key it
 * finds to exist in every offered dictionary. Adding a section with
 * untranslated copy therefore fails here, without anyone remembering to update
 * this file.
 *
 * Scope note: an earlier revision also asserted the editor's ribbon keys here,
 * because the landing embedded a live instance of the editor and rendered them
 * inside the page. That section is gone, so the assertion went with it. The
 * ribbon's Portuguese stays — it is a correct translation of real application
 * strings, and the editor is one click away — it is simply no longer the
 * landing's business to gate it.
 *
 * The repo-wide locale-parity test (src/lib/i18n/__tests__) is deliberately
 * untouched: it covers all fourteen dictionaries and a different namespace.

   * (`t('landing.' + key)`), and `eduNow1`, `eduNow2`, `eduNow3` — three of
   * the four — are exactly those. Checking a superset costs nothing; checking
   * only what a regex can find was worth nothing here.

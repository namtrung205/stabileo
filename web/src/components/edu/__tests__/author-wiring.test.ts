/**
 * The authoring panel is actually reachable.
 *
 * This exists because of a real failure: the button was wired, the state
 * flipped, and NOTHING happened — the branch rendering the author sat after
 * `{:else if !hasExercise}`, which is true exactly when the button is on
 * screen, so it could never be reached. No unit test caught it, because every
 * unit involved was correct. Only the arrangement was wrong.
 *
 * Reading the source is a blunt instrument, and it is the right one here: the
 * property is about ORDER, and it is cheap to check and expensive to
 * rediscover in front of a user.

/**
 * Snap precedence regression test.
 *
 * Bug: with grid snap enabled, drawing an element to an off-grid existing
 * node would silently fail because the node search ran from the
 * grid-snapped position, missing nodes further than `nodeThreshold` from
 * the nearest grid intersection. The user had to disable grid snap to
 * connect cleanly.
 *
 * Fix: snapWithMidpoint searches for nodes from the RAW cursor position.
 * Grid snap is the fallback when no node and no midpoint match.

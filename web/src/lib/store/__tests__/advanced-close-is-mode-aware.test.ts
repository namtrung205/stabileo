/**
 * Closing an advanced analysis must clear the slot for the mode it ran in.
 *
 * The Advanced panel shows one analysis at a time and offers a ✕ to end it.
 * Whether it is running is read from the store — `pdeltaResult` in 2D,
 * `pdeltaResult3D` in 3D — and that check was mode-aware from the start. The
 * matching `close` was not: it always called the 2D clear. So in 3D the ✕ left
 * the 3D slot set, `isActive` immediately returned true again, the header came
 * straight back, and the analysis could not be exited at all — the panel was
 * stuck on it with no route back to the menu.
 *
 * Three analyses have per-mode slots. The test reads the source rather than
 * driving the component because the defect is in the pairing of two functions,
 * which is visible statically and cheap to hold.

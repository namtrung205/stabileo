/**
 * Selection identity, which is what makes "go back" work.
 *
 * ── Why this has its own test ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It shipped wrong once, and it failed in the quietest possible way. Identity was compared on
 * `barId` and `solidId` alone, which is correct for a click in the viewport — bar ids differ —
 * and catastrophic for a click in the member list, where BOTH fields are `undefined` on every
 * selection. Two different members therefore compared as the same thing, nothing was ever
 * pushed onto the history, and the "previous" control simply never appeared. No error, no
 * warning: a feature that was present in the code and absent from the screen.

/**

 *
 * ── Why one call and not three ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A user who clicks a conflict marker is asking two things at once: what is this, and where am
 * I. Answering only the first leaves them with a fuller panel and the same wall of steel, so
 * `selectConflict` selects, points the camera, and — when asked — isolates the two members the
 * conflict names.
 *
 * The isolation is opt-in because the same conflict is also reached from the detailing panel's
 * list, where a user stepping through rows would not thank a viewport that changes what it
 * shows between one row and the next.

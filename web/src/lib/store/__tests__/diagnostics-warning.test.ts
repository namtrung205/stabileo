/**
 * When the model-diagnostics warning is allowed to speak, and what hiding it may never do.
 *
 * ── The defect these pin ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PRO opened with a yellow "⚠ 3" over the right panel before the user had touched anything,
 * because `checkModel` reports `MODEL_FEW_NODES`, `MODEL_NO_ELEMENTS` and `MODEL_NO_SUPPORTS`
 * for an empty model and the chip rendered on `count > 0`. An empty workspace is not a defect.
 *
 * The last test in this file is the one that matters most: a dismissal is allowed to quieten a
 * notification and is never allowed to change what the design does. `checkModel` is the
 * authority the commands consult, and it does not know this module exists.

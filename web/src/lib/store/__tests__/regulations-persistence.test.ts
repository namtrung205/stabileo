/**
 * The regulation stack and the revision vector live on the model for the same reason
 * `codeSettings` does: every persistence path — .ded save/open, undo/redo, tab
 * capture/restore, autosave — goes through `snapshot()`/`restore()`.
 *
 * Both fields were declared on `StructureModel` AND on `ModelSnapshot` and were emitted
 * by neither. So a project opened from disk silently reverted to the default regulations,
 * an undo reverted them, and the revision vector every stored certificate is stamped
 * against was replaced by an empty one — which makes a stale certificate look current,
 * the precise failure the revision graph exists to prevent.
 *
 * These tests pin the round trip. They are written against `snapshot()`/`restore()`
 * rather than a component, because that pair is what all four persistence paths share.

/**
 * When the model-diagnostics warning is allowed to speak.
 *
 * ── The report this exists to answer ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * "A yellow warning sits over the right panel the moment PRO opens, before I have done
 * anything, and hovering it says `Fix before solving`."
 *
 * It was telling the truth and it was still wrong. `checkModel` on an empty model returns three
 * errors — `MODEL_FEW_NODES`, `MODEL_NO_ELEMENTS`, `MODEL_NO_SUPPORTS` — and the chip rendered
 * whenever that count was above zero. So an untouched PRO greeted every user with "⚠ 3" for the
 * crime of being empty. An empty workspace is not a defect; it is a workspace.
 *
 * ── The rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The warning needs BOTH an actionable diagnostic and a reason to believe the user wants to
 * hear about it. It appears when:
 *
 *   1. there is a model at all (a node exists) — an empty PRO is classified `empty` and stays
 *      silent however loudly `checkModel` complains; AND
 *   2. the session is ARMED, meaning the user has loaded or restored a project, tried to
 *      calculate, tried to design, run a verification, or opened Diagnostics themselves; AND
 *   3. at least one diagnostic survives at `error` severity; AND
 *   4. the current diagnostic set is not the one they dismissed.
 *
 * Arming on "a model exists" covers load and restore without instrumenting either path — a
 * model does not appear in PRO by itself. The explicit `arm()` calls cover the case the user
 * asked for by name: pressing Calculate on a model that cannot be calculated must explain
 * itself, even if the press is the first thing they did.
 *
 * ── The dismissal policy, and why this one ────────────────────────
 *
 * Dismissal is scoped to the DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURE, for the current session.
 *
 *   - It survives navigating away and back, so hiding it is worth doing.
 *   - It does not survive a reload: a fresh session is a fresh judgement.
 *   - It lapses the moment the diagnostics change — a new code, or a different count of an
 *     existing one, is a new fact and gets to interrupt again.
 *
 * The alternative — dismiss forever, per project — was rejected because it would have to be
 * persisted, and a hidden warning that outlives the session it was hidden in is how a project
 * gets handed over with a defect nobody can see any more.
 *
 * **Hiding this chip can never change what the design does.** The pre-solve gate in `ProPanel`
 * and the design commands call `checkModel` directly and refuse on their own; this module is
 * consulted by nothing but the chip. That separation is deliberate: a dismissal must be able to
 * quieten a notification without ever being able to falsify a state.

 * something the analysis needs; `blocking` is anything else at error severity. Provisional
 * proposals and bar conflicts are NOT here — they have their own surfaces (the badge, the
 * chips, the banners, the status panel) and folding them in would blur a proposal into a fault.

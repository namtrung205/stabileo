/**
 * The one place the design outcome and the provided verification are joined.
 *
 * ── Why it is a module and not two derived blocks ──────────────────
 *
 * It was two derived blocks — one in `RebarWorkspace`, one in `RebarScenePanel` — building the
 * same map from the same two stores. They drifted the first time the map gained a field: the
 * workspace threaded `verificationLimiting`, the sidebar did not, and the same member was
 * reported PROVISIONAL on the overlay and FAILED on the panel behind it. Two screens, one
 * model, two answers, no error.
 *
 * `element-status.ts` cannot host this: it is pure by contract and reads no store. So the join
 * lives here, next to the stores it reads, and both screens call it.

/**
 * The 3-D workspace's own state: what is open, what is selected, what is shown.
 *
 * ── Why a store and not component state ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The workspace is an overlay, and an overlay that is `{#if open}` unmounts when it closes.
 * Component state would therefore reset every time the user stepped back to the model to
 * check something — losing the layers they had turned off, the member they were looking at,
 * and the section they had cut. That is the opposite of "step out and come back".
 *
 * The MODEL is never touched by any of this. Nothing here writes to `modelStore`; opening and
 * closing the workspace is a view operation and the project is identical either side of it.
 *
 * ── What survives what: the persistence policy ─────────────────────
 *
 * Stated here because "does it remember my layers" has three different right answers depending
 * on what happened, and a viewer that is vague about which is which reads as broken:
 *
 *   CLOSING the workspace keeps everything — layers, section, selection, isolation, history.
 *   The user is stepping out to look at the model, not abandoning the inspection.
 *
 *   RELOADING the page resets every switch to its default: all families on, reinforcement on,
 *   concrete on, conflicts on, nothing isolated. Nothing here is written to storage, and that is
 *   deliberate rather than unfinished. The autosave restores the PROJECT, which is the user's
 *   work; the switch positions are a view of it, and a restore that brought back "columns
 *   hidden" would hand a returning user an incomplete picture of their own building with no
 *   indication that anything was missing. A default open shows everything the document contains.
 *
 *   A DOCUMENT CHANGE under the workspace calls `reset()`, which drops the selection, the
 *   isolation, the status filter and the section — they name things that may no longer exist —
 *   and leaves the LAYER switches alone, because a family is a family whatever the revision.
 *
 * ── Why the selection history is a stack ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Inspecting a cage is a walk: this column, then the footing under it, then back. A single
 * "previous" slot handles one step and then lies about the one before. A bounded stack
 * handles the walk and cannot grow without limit.

/**
 * Opening the 3-D reinforcement workspace — one operation, two buttons.
 *
 * ── Why this is a module and not a function in a component ─────────
 *
 * PR20 promotes "Ver modelo 3D" out of the detailing disclosure and onto the Design command
 * row, because the viewer is the RESULT of the design and was reachable only from a panel two
 * levels below it. The old button stays where it is, beside the exports it belongs with.
 *
 * Two buttons with the same name must not be two operations. They are not: both call
 * `openRebar3D`, so the picture the user gets is the same picture whichever they press, built
 * from the same document instance as the report, the schedule and the drawings.
 *
 * ── Why the document is rebuilt on every open ──────────────────────
 *
 * `detailingStore.document` may hold a revision built before the last rebar edit. Opening on it
 * would show a cage that no longer matches the schedule beside it. Building here is what keeps
 * the 3-D view a projection of the same instance the exports render, rather than of a second
 * document that happens to agree.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything structural. It builds, it opens, it reports what happened.

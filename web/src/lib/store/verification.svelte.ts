// Verification store — the single source of truth for RC design state.
//
// PR15 ARCHITECTURE
// ─────────────────
// Two INDEPENDENT freshness axes, which the previous implementation conflated:
//
//   analysisRevision  — bumped on every real model mutation and every new solve.
//                       Governs whether retained demand data is still valid.
//   demandRevision    — bumped when station demand data is replaced.
//                       Part of the provided-verification memo key.
//   baselineRevision  — the analysisRevision captured when the code-check baseline
//                       (required steel, memos, interaction diagrams) was computed.
//                       `isBaselineStale` compares it with the current analysis.
//
// Reinforcement edits touch NEITHER axis. Provided-reinforcement verification is
// DERIVED state, memoised per element on (rebarHash, demandRevision), so it is never
// "stale" — it is recomputed or it is a cache hit. This is what makes an edit cheap
// (one cache miss) and honest (the numbers shown are always current), and it is why
// `clear()` must never be called from a rebar-edit path.
//
// The store owns no model access: `_setReinforcementProvider` is wired in
// store/index.ts, mirroring the existing `_setModelFlatnessProvider` pattern.

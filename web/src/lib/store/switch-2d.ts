/**
 * switch-2d.ts — carrying a 3D model into the 2D workspace.
 *
 * # The question this asks
 *
 * A 3D model cannot simply be looked at in 2D: the 2D solver has three
 * degrees of freedom per node and no notion of an out-of-plane coordinate, so
 * SOMETHING has to be decided about the third dimension before the switch can
 * mean anything. There are exactly three answers, and they are answers to
 * different questions:
 *
 *   * **Stay in 3D** — the switch was a mistake.
 *   * **Project** — flatten everything onto a plane. Answers "what does all of
 *     this look like from the side", which for a warehouse is every frame
 *     drawn on top of one frame.
 *   * **Slice** — take what lies in ONE plane, at a distance you choose.
 *     Answers "give me the frame on grid line 12", which is usually what was
 *     meant, and which the old dialog could not do at all.
 *
 * The fourth — erase and start empty — is not an answer to the question; it is
 * declining to bring the model at all, which is why it sits apart and asks
 * again before doing it.
 *
 * # Why a module and not a component
 *
 * Two callers already need this: the ribbon in the current shell and the
 * legacy toolbar PRO still mounts. Two implementations of "replace the model,
 * remember the original, remap the plane, clear the results" is two chances to
 * forget the backup — and the backup is the only thing standing between a user
 * and the loss of a 3D model they spent an afternoon on.

/**
 * view-mode.ts — editing and reading results are two modes, never both.
 *
 * # The state this prevents
 *
 * The app can arm a drawing tool and show a diagram at the same time, and when
 * it does the interface claims something false: that you are placing nodes ON a
 * moment diagram. Nothing crashes; the ribbon simply lights a construction
 * command and a result command together, and the canvas shows a structure you
 * are apparently editing and a field you are apparently reading.
 *
 * They are different jobs. You build the model, you solve it, you read what
 * came out — and going back to building means the answer no longer describes
 * what is on screen.
 *
 * # Why this lives in a module rather than in a store
 *
 * The rule couples two stores: choosing a diagram must disarm a tool, and
 * arming a tool must clear the diagram. Putting it inside either one makes them
 * import each other. Putting it in the components that trigger it — which is
 * where it started — means every new entry point has to remember, and the
 * results toolbar did not: its diagram buttons wrote `diagramType` directly and
 * left whatever tool was armed exactly where it was.
 *
 * So the transitions are functions, both stores are imported here, and a caller
 * expresses INTENT ("show me this diagram") rather than performing two writes
 * and hoping they stay in step.

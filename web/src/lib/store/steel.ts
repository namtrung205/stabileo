/**
 * The metallic surface's state, kept apart from the concrete one on purpose.
 *
 * ── Why a separate store ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `verificationStore` holds the concrete pipeline's state: contexts, outcomes, the
 * code-check baseline, and the revision counters that decide when any of it is stale. Steel
 * has none of those things — no contexts, no outcomes, no baseline, because no metallic
 * authority exists to produce them — and putting a metallic slice inside it would mean
 * every consumer of `providedSummary`, `getDisplayStatus` and `hasResults` acquiring a
 * second material to reason about.
 *
 * Separate is also what was asked for: the states of steel and concrete stay separate.
 *
 * And practically: PR #125 is rewriting `verification.ts`. A new file collides with
 * nothing.
 *
 * ── It derives, it does not accumulate ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The inventory is a pure function of the model plus two booleans, so nothing here is state
 * that can drift out of step — see the note on the memo below for why it is a keyed cache
 * rather than a `$derived`.

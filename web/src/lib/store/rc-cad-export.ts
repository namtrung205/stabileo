/**
 * The production action behind Foundations → *Export CAD handoff*.
 *
 * This is the adapter, and it is deliberately thin: it COLLECTS production values from the
 * stores and hands them to the pure producer. Every engineering decision lives in
 * `rc-cad-handoff.ts`; every number here is read, never computed.
 *
 * ── Prerequisites are checked before anything is written ────────
 *
 * A manifest that describes a cage the current model no longer produces is worse than no
 * manifest, because its revision stamps look authoritative. So the action refuses, with a
 * reason the UI shows verbatim, when:
 *
 *   * the footing has no detailing assembly — nothing has been generated;
 *   * the assembly's demand revision has moved — the bars were generated against demands that
 *     have since changed, and `isDemandStale` is the same test the review gate uses;
 *   * the producer itself refuses, because the data cannot determine the connection without
 *     inventing part of it.
 *
 * ── And validated before it is offered ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The produced document is run through BOTH validation layers before the download is offered.
 * A manifest that fails its own schema must never reach a consumer: the consumer would be
 * right to reject it and the user would have no way to know why.

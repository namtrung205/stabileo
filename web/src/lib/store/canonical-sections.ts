 * Re-resolve canonical state for every section in the map.

 * The engine initialises asynchronously, so at app start — and for a model
 * loaded before the WASM module is ready — `resolveSectionState` can only
 * report properties-only. Nothing would ever revisit that decision, leaving
 * otherwise fine catalogue profiles permanently without geometry.
 *
 * This runs once the engine is ready, and is a no-op for sections whose
 * resolved digest matches the stored one. It never invalidates results:
 * refreshing geometry is not a model edit.
 *
 * A section already geometry-backed WITH a torsion answer is skipped without
 * recomputing: within a session the engine build cannot change, so a fully
 * resolved state cannot go stale, and re-resolving it would pay a WASM
 * geometry build (and possibly a Saint-Venant solve) per section per load
 * just to learn nothing changed. `jProvenance === 'unavailable'` is the
 * marker of "restored before the torsion pass ran" — those are retried, as
 * are genuine torsion failures, which is bounded and correct.
 *
 * Returns the updated map, or null if nothing changed.

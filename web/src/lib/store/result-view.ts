/**
 * result-view.ts — WHICH quantity is on screen, and HOW it is drawn.
 *
 * # Two questions that had become one
 *
 * `diagramType` answers both at once. `'axial'` means the axial force drawn as
 * a diagram; `'axialColor'` means the same quantity drawn as member colour;
 * `'colorMap'` means some quantity — named separately in `colorMapKind` — drawn
 * as a heat map. Three encodings for two independent facts.
 *
 * That worked while member colour existed only for axial. It stops working the
 * moment every quantity can be shown three ways, because every reader of
 * `diagramType` then has to know all the encodings to answer "what is the user
 * actually looking at" — the ribbon needs it to light the right command, the
 * results panel needs it to offer the right choices, and each was deriving it
 * separately.
 *
 * So the pair is read and written through here. Nothing else needs to know
 * that member colour is spelled `axialColor` while a heat map is spelled
 * `colorMap` plus a second field.
 *
 * # Why not just add a field
 *
 * Because `diagramType` is what the viewports switch on, what the store
 * persists, and what a saved model carries. A parallel field would be a second
 * source of truth for the same question and would drift from it — which is the
 * defect this codebase has already paid for more than once.

/**
 * When the autosave actually runs.
 *
 * ── Why a 30-second timer is not enough ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The old autosave fired on a `setInterval` and nowhere else. That is a defensible design for
 * a model somebody is editing node by node — at most half a minute of typing is at risk. It is
 * indefensible for the operations this branch added, because each of them is a single click
 * that produces minutes of computed work: `Calcular`, `Diseñar`, `Diseñar pisos`,
 * `Generar detallado`. Losing one of those is not losing thirty seconds of typing, it is
 * losing the run.
 *
 * So the timer stays as the floor, and every operation that produces expensive state asks for
 * a save when it finishes. `requestAutosave` is that ask.
 *
 * ── Coalescing, and why it is not a debounce ───────────────────────
 *
 * Writes must not overlap: two in-flight writes race for the revision counter, and the loser
 * silently retires the winner's record. A debounce would fix that by DELAYING work, which is
 * the wrong trade for a save. This coalesces instead — a request that arrives while a write is
 * in flight is remembered, and one more write runs when that one lands. The state finally
 * stored is therefore always at least as new as the newest request, and never older.
 *
 * Nothing here decides whether a save succeeded. That is `saveAutosave`'s job, and it reports
 * failure to the user itself; this module only records the outcome so a panel or a test can
 * read it back.

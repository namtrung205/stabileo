 * decides whether punching applies, and nothing more. So every column-supported panel reported
 * its governing check as unverified for want of forces the solver had already produced. This is
 * the rest of it.
 *
 * ── Which end of which column ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A column below the joint meets it at its TOP node; a column above meets it at its BOTTOM
 * node. Which node is `nodeI` and which is `nodeJ` is a modelling accident, so the two are told
 * apart by ELEVATION — the column's higher-z node — and the axial force is read from the end
 * that is actually at the joint. Reading the far end instead would report the force at the
 * other floor, and with self-weight in the model those differ by the column's own weight.
 *
 * Compression is positive here and `ElementForces3D` reports axial with tension positive, so
 * every reading is negated once, at the point it is read.
 *
 * ── The third force ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Beams framing into the joint deliver load to the column WITHOUT crossing the slab's critical
 * perimeter, and so does any load applied at the joint node. Both are collected, because the
 * punching demand is the part of the axial step that does cross the perimeter, and calling the
 * whole step "punching" would fail an ordinary beam-and-slab floor on a mechanism that is not

 * ── Why this reads the model and takes no argument ──────────────────
 *
 * It used to be called as `maxRevision(store.assemblies)`, and `store` is a `$derived`. A
 * `$derived` is lazy and memoised: it recomputes when a dependency changes AND it is read, so
 * whether it is current at the moment a command runs depends on what ELSE read it in the same
 * tick. That made the revision counter a function of unrelated parts of the UI — mounting one
 * more panel elsewhere in the tab was enough to make every regeneration report revision 1.
 *
 * This branch already found and fixed the identical class twice, a few lines away, and said so
 * in the source: the floor-assembly merge and `buildDocument` both read
 * `modelStore.model.detailing` directly because a `$derived` does not recompute inside the
 * synchronous call that wrote it. These two callers were left on the derived.
 *
 * The argument is REMOVED rather than left optional. A helper that can be handed either source
 * is a helper that will be handed the wrong one again; there is exactly one correct source for
 * "what revision is this project on", and it is the persisted model — which is also what a
 * reopened project carries.

 * on screen next to a retired document is a visible inconsistency the user can read.
 *
 * It stops being harmless now that the run holds BARS. Change the layer-order preference and
 * the panel would go on drawing the previous mat — real bar positions, real elevations, real
 * marks — with nothing saying they belong to a design the project no longer specifies. Stale
 * geometry presented as current is the one failure the whole revision graph exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the run records its inputs and the panel compares. It does NOT re-run: regeneration stays
 * an explicit command, because a panel that silently redesigned a footing on every keystroke
 * would be making the engineer's decision for them.
 *
 * The mat preferences and every footing's own revision, and nothing else — those are exactly

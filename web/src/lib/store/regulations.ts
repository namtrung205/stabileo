/**
 * Project regulations store.

 * Owns the role bindings, the revision vector, and the pending/applied transition that
 * makes "changing a load regulation must not silently relabel existing loads" enforceable
 * rather than aspirational.
 *
 * ── The transition ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `choose()` stages a change as PENDING. Nothing downstream moves. The UI can then ask
 * `pendingConsequence()` what applying it would cost, show that to the user, and call
 * either `applyPending()` or `cancelPending()`.
 *
 * A load-affecting role never applies from the Design surface at all: `requestChange()`
 * returns a navigation intent so the Design panel can send the user to Loads, where the
 * before/after preview lives. The Design surface asks; Loads decides.
 *
 * Design-only roles (concrete, steel, …) apply in place, because the forces do not move
 * and there is nothing to preview.

     * THE design code for reinforced concrete — the one authoritative answer.
     *
     * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * The concrete design code was being chosen in three places at once. A dropdown beside
     * the Design commands wrote `verificationStore.activeCodeId`, which reached the code
     * check, the candidate search and detailing. Project Regulations bound a `concrete`
     * role, which reached only detailing's EDITION. And a legacy v1 field,
     * `codeSettings.concreteEdition`, silently rewrote the adapter inside `design-run`.
     *
     * They could disagree, and the disagreement was not cosmetic: detailing could take its
     * edition from one source and its adapter from another, so a member could be verified
     * against one edition's clauses and detailed under the other's. The dropdown also
     * offered CIRSOC 201-2005, which the role catalogue correctly marks
     * `UNAVAILABLE_SOURCE` because the official 2005 text is not supplied with this app.
     *
     * Everything that needs a concrete design code now asks here. `null` means the project
     * has not bound a usable one, and the caller must GATE rather than pick a default —
     * silently falling back to CIRSOC is how a project gets verified against rules it never
     * chose.

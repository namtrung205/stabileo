/**
 * Put a generated model into the app, with its assumptions attached.
 *
 * ── One undo step, one provenance record ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Generating replaces the model. That is a big, deliberate action and it has to be a single
 * undoable one — a user who presses Generate on the wrong parameters must get back exactly
 * what they had, not a half-cleared model.
 *
 * ── The assumptions are the point ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A generated shed is 600 members nobody drew, sized by profiles nobody checked, resting on
 * decisions the generator made: chords continuous, web pinned, purlins rolled to the pitch,
 * the torsional constant of a box section not computed. Every one of those is defensible
 * and none of them is obvious from looking at the result.
 *
 * `ModelProvenance` already travels inside `ModelSnapshot`, so it survives save, reload,
 * undo and tab switches. Writing the assumptions there rather than into a toast is the
 * difference between a disclosure and a notification.
 *
 * The clock is a parameter. This module never reads it, so a test gets a deterministic
 * record and the caller owns the timestamp — the same rule the detailing modules follow.

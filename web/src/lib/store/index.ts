// carries a support reaction rather than contributing stiffness — routing them through it
// cleared the solve on every edit and left every footing reporting "no reaction" at design
// time. But widening a base, or restating an allowable bearing pressure, invalidates the
// footing design and every drawing, schedule and report built from it. PR18 declared that
// edge and never connected it, so a project could edit a footing and keep issuing the
// document that justified the old one.
//
// Non-destructive: `supersedeDocuments` keeps the old revision and its content and moves it
// to the superseded list, because a project that cannot show what it previously issued cannot
// answer the only question that matters after something goes wrong.

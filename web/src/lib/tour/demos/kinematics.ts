/**
 * "Análisis cinemático" — is this structure even solvable?
 *
 * The one advanced tool that answers a question you have BEFORE solving, and
 * the reason it is first: a mechanism does not produce a wrong answer, it
 * produces no answer, and the error the solver returns is about matrices
 * rather than about the beam.
 *
 * The walkthrough removes a support on purpose. Reading the panel on a
 * structure that is already fine teaches the layout; watching the verdict flip
 * from isostatic to a mechanism, and reading what it says to add, teaches what
 * the panel is FOR.

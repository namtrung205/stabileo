/**
 * "Análisis de sección" — what the internal forces do to the material.
 *
 * The densest tool in Basic, so the explanation is split rather than piled
 * into one card: what the sliders move, then what surrounds the section, then
 * the stress state below it. Three cards of one idea each beat one card of
 * eight that a reader skims.
 *
 * It needs a solved model to have anything to show, so the walkthrough solves
 * first rather than arming the tool and letting the reader hit "calculate the
 * model first".

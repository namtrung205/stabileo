/**
 * "Ajustes" — what the panel nobody opens actually controls.
 *
 * Settings sits behind a gear in the corner and holds twenty-five switches,
 * which is exactly the shape of a panel people open once and close. Most of
 * them are cosmetic and explain themselves; this walkthrough is for the four
 * that change how the app behaves, and it ends on the one that is genuinely
 * hidden.
 *
 * Live calculation is last on purpose. It is the single setting that changes
 * the rhythm of using Stabileo — edit and the results follow, with no press
 * — and it is a full-width button below a list of checkboxes, which is where
 * a reader has already stopped looking.

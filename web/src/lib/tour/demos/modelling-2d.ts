/**
 * "Dibujar una viga" — build one specific structure, start to finish.
 *
 * # Why it does not let you draw anything you like
 *
 * A free-form modelling tutorial cannot check its own work. Left to place
 * nodes anywhere, a reader arrives at Solve with a mechanism, gets a red
 * error, and the walkthrough ends in a failure it caused. With one target —
 * a simply supported beam under a distributed load — every step has a
 * condition that either holds or does not, and the last step is guaranteed to
 * produce a result.
 *
 * # Why the drawing steps spotlight the CANVAS
 *
 * They pointed at the ribbon command instead, which is where the tool is
 * armed — and the overlay then darkened everything except a button the reader
 * had no reason to press, while the model they were being asked to draw on
 * sat behind the dark. The step cannot be completed and there is no way
 * forward, because it is waiting for two nodes that cannot be placed.
 *
 * The tool is armed by the step itself, so the command needs no pointing at.
 * What the reader needs to see is where to click.
 *
 * # Why sections and materials come before solving
 *
 * They are model data, not an adjustment: a member has a section and a
 * material from the moment it exists, and the solver reads both. An earlier
 * draft of this walkthrough put them after Solve, to show the deflection
 * changing as the section changed — a real effect, taught in the wrong order.
 * Somebody learning this would come away believing the section is something
 * you revisit afterwards, and the order a tutorial demonstrates is the order
 * it teaches.
 *
 * The effect survives anyway, in the last card: change the section and press
 * Solve again. That is also closer to the truth, because seeing it means
 * running the analysis twice.

/**
 * "Primeros pasos" — load, solve, read.
 *
 * The shortest useful path through Basic, and the one `/demo` opens with. It
 * exists to answer one question: what does this app do? Three acts — there is
 * a model, you press one button, and the answers appear — and it deliberately
 * teaches nothing about drawing, because someone who has not yet seen a result
 * has no reason to care how a node is placed.
 *
 * Every step that changes the model does it through the same code the buttons
 * use, so the demo cannot drift from the app: `loadExample` is what the
 * examples menu calls, and `solve` dispatches the event the Solve command
 * dispatches.

/**
 * "Moverse y seleccionar" — the two gestures everything else is built on.
 *
 * One walkthrough for both viewports rather than two, because the ideas are
 * identical and only the hand movement differs: in 2D a drag pans, in 3D the
 * same drag orbits and panning needs Shift. Splitting them would teach the
 * same three concepts twice and hide the one comparison worth making, so the
 * demo switches dimension in the middle and points at the difference.
 *
 * It ends on Delete. That is not padding — deleting is the destructive
 * gesture, its meaning depends on which kinds are armed, and a user who has
 * just learned to sweep a rectangle is one keypress away from finding out the
 * hard way.

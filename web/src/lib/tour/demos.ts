/**
 * demos.ts — the catalogue of guided walkthroughs.
 *
 * # Why a catalogue instead of one tour
 *
 * `/demo` used to be a single fourteen-step walk that tried to cover the whole
 * of Basic at once: load, draw, solve, read results, and the advanced panels.
 * It pointed at eight anchors, six of which live inside the left toolbar — and
 * desktop Basic stopped mounting that toolbar when the ribbon replaced it. Half
 * the tour was aiming at elements that are not on the screen.
 *
 * Rebuilding it as one long walk would repeat the mistake in a different way:
 * a person who wants to know how selection works should not have to sit
 * through drawing a beam to get there. So there are several short ones, each
 * answering a single question, and a menu to pick from.
 *
 * # What belongs in one
 *
 * One question, and short enough that a reader finishes it. The estimate in
 * `seconds` is shown in the menu for exactly that reason — nobody should start
 * a ninety-second walkthrough thinking it is a tooltip.

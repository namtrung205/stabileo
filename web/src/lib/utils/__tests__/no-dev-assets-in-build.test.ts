/**
 * PROOF that the built site carries nothing that only exists on a developer's machine.
 *
 * ── The defect ──
 *
 * index.html swapped in the yellow development favicon with an inline script that
 * checked `location.hostname`. The script was correct. It still shipped the wrong icon
 * to everybody, because scripts/prerender.ts drives the built site in a headless
 * browser served from localhost: the swap fired, and the capture of `document.head`
 * happened after it. Nineteen pages went out declaring `/favicon-dev.svg`, and it sat
 * in the tab on stabileo.com until somebody noticed by eye.
 *
 * ── Why this is not an e2e test ──
 *
 * It was one, and driving a browser over seven pages to read seven strings cost seven
 * contexts. CI answered with `browser.newContext: Test ended` and took two unrelated
 * @smoke specs down with it — the known wedge documented in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
 *
 * ── Why it asserts on the bundle, not on `dist/` ──
 *
 * The prerendered pages are photographs of the bundle. If the dev swap is absent from
 * the emitted JavaScript, no browser driving it can produce a page that names the dev
 * icon — so the bundle is the property worth asserting, and the nineteen photographs
 * follow. Reading a checked-out `dist/` would prove less and cost more: it is
 * gitignored, is rewritten by `build`, `build:only` and Playwright's `VITE_E2E=1`
 * webServer alike, and is simply absent on a fresh clone. A test that reads it either
 * asserts against whichever build ran last, or skips itself — and a gate that skips
 * itself when the artifact is missing reports green on precisely the machine where
 * nobody has checked.
 *
 * So this spawns its own build, like `e2e-hook-gating.test.ts` does, and is declared in
 * PRODUCTION_BUILD_TESTS for the same reason. It cannot go inert.

/**
 * Every element on screen gets reached, whichever way it is drawn.
 *
 * # The defect
 *
 * `ctx.elementGroups` is a PARTIAL registry, by design: in wireframe render
 * mode a plain member is a segment of one batched `LineSegments2` and is given
 * no group of its own. Only members needing extra geometry — a section
 * extrusion, a hinge glyph — get one.
 *
 * Four flat colour maps and the verification labels iterated that map. In
 * wireframe, which is what Basic 3D opens in, they therefore reached almost
 * nothing: axial-as-member-colour left a 633-member industrial shed entirely
 * white. Nothing threw; the loop simply had nothing to loop over.
 *
 * The lesson generalises past this bug: a map that is *usually* complete is the
 * worst kind of data structure to iterate, because it works in every case
 * anyone tries by hand.

/**
 * The rule, enforced on the code rather than trusted to memory.
 *
 * The helper above has been correct since the day it was written, and the bug
 * came back anyway — twice. Not because anyone changed it, but because the
 * next piece of code that needed to colour every member iterated the partial
 * map instead of calling it, and iterating a map that is *usually* complete
 * works in every case anyone checks by hand.
 *
 * The third occurrence was `syncSelection`: selecting a member in Basic 3D
 * highlighted nothing at all, on every model, because in wireframe there were
 * no groups to iterate. The colour maps had been fixed; this had not.
 *
 * So the guard is on the pattern: a loop over `elementGroups` may not push a
 * colour into the batched mesh, because the members it misses are exactly the
 * ones whose only colour lives there.
 *
 * It reads source text, with the limits that implies — a loop written some
 * other way slips past. It catches the shape that has actually recurred three
 * times, which is what a guard is for.

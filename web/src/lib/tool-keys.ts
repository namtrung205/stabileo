/**
 * Which letter arms which tool — the ONE place this is defined.
 *
 * This table existed in four places (the keyboard handler, the ribbon's
 * shortcut hints, the floating toolbar's tooltips and the mobile toolbar's
 * button labels) and had already drifted: two of them showed (H) for pan
 * while the handler armed it with A — and H has toggled the axes display
 * since long before the ribbon existed, so the displayed shortcut silently
 * did something else.
 *
 * The bindings themselves are the long-standing ones; do not change a letter
 * here without checking it does not collide with the other global shortcuts
 * in React's KeyboardShortcuts.tsx (H is the axes toggle).

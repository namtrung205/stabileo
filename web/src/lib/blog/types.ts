/**
 * The blog's content model.
 *
 * A post is structured data, not a string of HTML. Two reasons, and both are
 * about the same thing — a post has to exist in three languages:
 *
 *  - A translator edits sentences, not markup. Handing them a paragraph at a
 *    time means a Portuguese post cannot end up with an unclosed tag or a lost
 *    table row, and a missing translation is a missing field the tests can see
 *    rather than a page that renders half in English.
 *  - Nothing here is ever passed to `{@html}`. The renderer maps each block to
 *    an element, so a post cannot inject markup into the page even by accident.
 *
 * The block set is deliberately small. It covers what an engineering article
 * needs — prose, headings, lists, a pull quote, a table of numbers — and
 * stops. A post that wants something else is a reason to add a block kind
 * here, with a renderer and a test, not a reason to reach for raw HTML.

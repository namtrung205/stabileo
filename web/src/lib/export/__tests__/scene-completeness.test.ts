/**
 * The scene must show everything the detailing actually produced.
 *
 * ── The regression this file exists to make impossible ─────────────
 *
 * A 7-storey building rendered 12 705 bars and looked convincingly full. It was missing
 * every column tie in the model — 8 251 pieces — because `generateColumnStack` returns its
 * ties as a ZONE SCHEDULE (lift, extent, spacing, diameter) and never as geometry, and the
 * column path appended only `gen.bars`. Nothing was wrong with the scene: it faithfully
 * projected a document that did not contain the steel.
 *
 * "Lots of bars" and "all the bars" look identical in a cage, which is why this cannot be a
 * visual check. Every assertion below is a COUNT, taken either against the detailing source
 * or against a floor the count cannot fall through.
 *
 * ── Why the assertions are shaped as floors, not equalities ────────
 *
 * Bar counts move whenever a spacing rule, a section or a demand changes, and a test pinned
 * to 8 251 would fail on every legitimate improvement while catching nothing. What must never
 * happen is a FAMILY going to zero, or a whole role disappearing, so the floors are set where
 * only a structural loss can breach them.

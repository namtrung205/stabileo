/**
 * migration.ts — restoring canonical section state after a load.
 *
 * # Why loading needs its own pass
 *
 * `Section.canonical` serializes with the section, so a saved file carries the
 * geometry, the digest and the derived properties it had when it was written.
 * None of that is trustworthy on the way back in: the file may predate the
 * canonical layer, may have been written by a newer schema, may have been
 * hand-edited, or may simply be stale relative to the dimensions stored beside
 * it. Solver preparation is synchronous and reads the cached values directly,
 * so anything wrong here becomes wrong numbers with no further chance to
 * notice.
 *
 * The restore pass therefore *re-derives* canonical state from the section's
 * own dimensions and compares. The persisted digest is treated as a claim to
 * be checked, never as an answer to be trusted.
 *
 * # What is deliberately NOT done
 *
 * Nothing is invented to make a section canonical. A file whose section lacks
 * the dimensions its family needs comes back properties-only — the same answer
 * it would get if it had been created that way — and keeps its declared A/I/J
 * so it still solves globally.

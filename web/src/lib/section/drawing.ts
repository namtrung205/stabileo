/**
 * drawing.ts — the geometry a detailed-analysis view is allowed to render.
 *
 * # The defect this closes
 *
 * The drawing and the numbers came from two different resolvers. `section-
 * stress.ts` reconstructed an outline from the section's *name* and invented
 * thicknesses when they were missing, while the stress numbers came from Rust.
 * Nothing checked that the two described the same section, so a renamed
 * profile drew one shape and computed another.
 *
 * Here the drawing consumes the exact polygons the numerical path used, and
 * `assertSameGeometry` makes a mismatch stop the visualization instead of
 * rendering contradictory data. A guard that cannot fail proves nothing, so a
 * test deliberately feeds it a different section.

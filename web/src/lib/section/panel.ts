/**
 * panel.ts — the canonical detailed-analysis result the UI renders.
 *
 * # Why an adapter rather than logic inside the components
 *
 * `SectionStressPanel` and `CrossSectionDrawing` both need the same thing: the
 * canonical geometry, the canonical bending field, and proof the two describe
 * one section. Putting that in either component would duplicate it in the
 * other and leave the guard reachable from only one of them. So it lives here,
 * is pure, and is testable without mounting Svelte.
 *
 * # What is canonical and what is not
 *
 * Every component now comes from the section's own geometry: axial and bending
 * in closed form, transverse shear from longitudinal equilibrium, torsion from
 * Saint-Venant — or from a closed form or published table where one exists.
 *
 * The result still reports its components separately rather than handing back
 * one undifferentiated "stress". That mattered when shear was restricted to
 * four shapes (`V*Q/(I*b)` needs a single well-defined width, which an angle, a
 * closed tube and an arbitrary polygon do not have) and it matters now for a
 * different reason: a section declared by properties alone has no geometry, so
 * it must still be prevented from presenting a combined criterion.

/**
 * outline.ts — one SVG path builder for a section outline, shared by every
 * place in the app that draws one.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Checkpoint 2B made the *stress panel* draw canonical geometry, and left the
 * six other places that draw a section — the profile picker, the section
 * changer, the shape builder, the element details panel, the sections table
 * and the PRO sections tab — still calling `crossSectionPath()`, which builds
 * a parallel-flange, sharp-cornered outline from `h/b/tw/tf` alone.
 *
 * The result was visible and was reported: the same IPN 300 looked square in
 * the picker and correctly tapered in Section Analysis. That is the two-
 * resolver defect again, just moved. A user cannot be expected to trust a
 * number attached to a picture of a different shape.
 *
 * So there is one path builder, it prefers canonical geometry, and when it
 * cannot have it the caller is *told* rather than silently handed an
 * approximation.

 * Memoized per profile: the picker renders one row per catalogue entry and
 * re-renders on every search keystroke, and an uncached call here is a full
 * canonical resolution (a WASM round trip) PER ROW PER KEYSTROKE.

 * Only canonical outlines are cached. A resolution made before the engine is
 * ready (or while the feature flag is off) falls back to the approximate
 * parametric outline, and caching THAT would pin a degraded thumbnail for the
 * rest of the session — the exact picker/section mismatch this module exists
 * to eliminate. An uncached fallback re-resolves on the next render, by which

/**
 * state.ts — solver-ready canonical section state.
 *
 * # Why this layer exists
 *
 * `buildSolverInput2D/3D` is synchronous and runs on every solve. Canonical
 * geometry lives in Rust behind a WASM call. Calling into WASM from inside
 * solver preparation would either make that path async — rippling through
 * every caller — or risk publishing whatever the call happened to return.
 *
 * So resolution happens at the *edges*: when a section is created, chosen from
 * the catalogue, edited, migrated or loaded. The validated result is stored on
 * the section atomically, and `buildSolverInput` only ever reads it.
 *
 * The stored state is a cache with an integrity field: `digest` identifies the
 * exact geometry it was derived from, so a consumer can prove the numbers it
 * is using and the outline it is drawing describe the same section.
 *
 * # Torsion
 *
 * `J` is deliberately NOT taken from the polygon engine. That engine computes
 * `J` by Routh's approximation, which is exact for a circle or ellipse and
 * materially wrong otherwise — measured, 56.9 % low on a rectangle and 37.0 %
 * high on an I-section. Feeding it into 3D global stiffness would be worse
 * than the declared value it replaced. Every `J` therefore carries provenance,
 * and a non-circular section keeps its authoritative or legacy value until
 * Checkpoint 2C computes a validated Saint-Venant constant.

/**
 * stress-state.ts — the complete stress state at one point of a section,
 * assembled entirely from canonical geometry.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * The section panel had two paths running side by side. The outline it drew
 * and the bending stress it plotted were canonical; the shear, the Mohr circle
 * and the failure criteria still came from the legacy resolver, which infers a
 * section's shape from its NAME and invents thicknesses when they are missing.
 * A user therefore read a Mohr circle built from a shape nobody verified,
 * drawn on top of an outline that was verified — and had no way to tell.
 *
 * This closes that. Every component here comes from the same polygons: axial
 * and bending in closed form, transverse shear from longitudinal equilibrium,
 * torsion from Saint-Venant. Mohr and the failure criteria are then pure
 * functions of the resulting sigma and tau, so those keep using the existing
 * helpers — they were never the problem.
 *
 * # What the caller must supply
 *
 * A point, centroid-relative. The panel has one because the user picks a fibre
 * on the drawing, and since the drawing is canonical the coordinates already
 * live in the right frame.

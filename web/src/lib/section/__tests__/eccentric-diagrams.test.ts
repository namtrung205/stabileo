/**
 * The eccentric load must reach the DIAGRAMS, not only the readout.
 *
 * The first version of this feature resolved an eccentric load correctly and
 * fed it to Mohr's circle, the tensors and the stress map — but the stress
 * diagrams kept plotting the model's own forces, because they come from a
 * different analysis path. The panel showed two load cases at once and only
 * the small print said which was which.
 *
 * Connecting the two paths means crossing a convention boundary, and that is
 * what this file pins:
 *
 *   * `stationForces2D` reports `my = M`; the diagram path wants the OPPOSITE
 *     sign to put tension on the same fibre. Same for `mz`.
 *   * the axes swap names: the diagram path's `yFiber` is the DEPTH, which is
 *     the canonical `z`, and its `zFiber` is the width, the canonical `y`.
 *
 * Both were established by measuring the two functions against each other, not
 * by reading the code. A sign error here does not throw — it draws a diagram
 * upside down, which looks entirely plausible.

/**
 * The torque gets from the solver to the stress, end to end.
 *
 * # Why this exists as its own file
 *
 * Every piece of the torsion chain had tests and every one of them passed while
 * the chain itself was broken. `stationForces3D` read a field named `txStart`;
 * every 3D result object the solver produces names it `mxStart`; the read was
 * optional, so it returned zero. Torsional shear, the warping split and the
 * warping normal stress were therefore zero everywhere in the application, for
 * every model, while the panel displayed "Mx = 8.00 kN·m" one row above the
 * words "no torque at this station".
 *
 * The unit tests could not see it because each one supplied its own input. The
 * only thing that would have caught it is a test that starts where the data
 * really starts — an `ElementForces3D` as the solver emits it — and follows it
 * all the way to a stress. That is what this is.
 *
 * The lesson generalises: a seam between two modules that agree on a shape but
 * not on a NAME is invisible to both of their test suites, and a cast at the
 * call site removes the last thing that would have objected.

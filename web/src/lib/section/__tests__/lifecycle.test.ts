/**
 * Canonical state must exist by the time the panel asks for it.
 *
 * Reported defect: selecting any standard catalogue profile and opening
 * Section Analysis reported "la sección seleccionada es amorfa" — an amorphous
 * section — even though a real profile was assigned and visible in both the
 * side panel and the element.
 *
 * Cause: `canonical` was populated only by `updateSection` and by restoring a
 * snapshot. A section created with `addSection` — which is what examples and
 * the default section use — never had it, so `supportsDetailedAnalysis`
 * correctly answered "no known geometry" and the panel refused. Compounding
 * it, the engine initialises asynchronously, so even a resolve at creation
 * time would have yielded properties-only at startup with nothing to revisit
 * it.

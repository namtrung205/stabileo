/**
 * What the extruded 3-D view draws for a generated section.
 *
 * ── The behaviour this replaces ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured on this branch before the fix, with a truss whose chord is a channel box and whose
 * post is a back-to-back angle pair:
 *
 *   2x UPN 100 []            shape=undefined → THREE.Shape with 13 points
 *   2x L 50x50x5 ][ (h=8mm)  shape=undefined → THREE.Shape with 13 points
 *   IPE 100                  shape=undefined → THREE.Shape with 13 points
 *
 * Thirteen points is `createIShape`. A generated section carried no `shape`, so every one of
 * them — compound and single, channel and angle — fell to the `default:` branch, which says
 * "Default to I-shape if we have h and b" and invents `tw` and `tf` from the depth. The
 * viewport was drawing an I-beam for two angles at a spacing, and for a single angle.

/**
 * Every switch in the rail, driven the way the rail drives it, asserted against the SCENE.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists next to `rebar-batching.test.ts` ──────────
 *
 * That file proves the renderer obeys a `SceneFilter`. It does, and it always did. What broke
 * was everything between the checkbox and that call: the store changed, the derived filter
 * recomputed, the tally beside the canvas updated, and `setVisibility` was never reached, so
 * all eight switches governed nothing while the whole suite stayed green.
 *
 * The gap was that no test ever crossed the two boundaries where the defect lived:
 *
 *   1. `switch position → SceneFilter`. That translation was four lines inside
 *      `RebarWorkspace.svelte`, and a component cannot be mounted in this project's test
 *      environment — so every existing test hand-wrote the filter it wanted. A test that
 *      restates the translation cannot fail when the translation is wrong. It is now
 *      `workspaceFilter`, a pure function, and this file drives it rather than a literal.
 *
 *   2. `SceneFilter → what is on screen`. Asserted here through `census()`, which is read off
 *      `mesh.visible` and `drawn`, not off the filter. The remaining boundary — the Svelte
 *      effect that carries one to the other — is only observable in a browser, and
 *      `e2e/rebar-toggles.spec.ts` is where it is asserted.
 *
 * So: this file owns "the switch means what it says", the spec owns "the switch is wired", and
 * `rebar-viewport-effects.test.ts` owns "it cannot be unwired the same way twice".

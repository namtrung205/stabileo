/**
 * Save → reload → restore → calculate, on a real project.
 *
 * ── The failure this file exists to keep dead ───────────────────────
 *
 * Opening `Edificio H.A. 7 pisos — PRO`, reloading, pressing Restaurar and then Calcular
 * produced two errors and no results:
 *
 *   Error al resolver 3D: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker':
 *   [object Array] could not be cloned.
 *
 *   Error en caso 3D "Superimposed dead (screed+finish+partitions)":
 *   Parse error: Error: invalid type: unit value, expected a sequence
 *
 * Three independent defects, all on the restore path, none of them in the solver:
 *
 *  1. `buildSolverInput3D` passed `constraints` and every shell's `nodes` list into the wire
 *     BY REFERENCE. Read off a reactive store those are proxies, and structured clone rejects
 *     a proxy outright — so `worker.postMessage` threw on EVERY solve of any model carrying a
 *     constraint, restored or not. The parallel path caught it and fell back to the sequential
 *     solver, which produced correct results, so the worker pool had silently stopped being
 *     used at all. (Measured on this building: 2.4 s sequential vs 478 ms across the pool.)
 *
 *  2. `restore()` copied each family one level deep, so a snapshot read out of `$state` — which
 *     is what the autosave banner and the tab manager both hold — put its nested PROXY arrays
 *     into the live model, where they outlived the load and reached the wire from a second
 *     direction.
 *
 *  3. `migrateConstraint` wrote `dofs: mapDofs(raw.dofs)` for a rigid link, materialising an
 *     explicit `dofs: undefined` on the (normal) constraints that carry no `dofs`. Rust spells
 *     that field `#[serde(default)] dofs: Vec<usize>`, and `#[serde(default)]` covers a MISSING
 *     field, not a present one holding a unit value — hence "expected a sequence". The named
 *     load case was not special: it was simply the first one the per-case fallback tried.
 *
 * The assertions below are therefore about the three invariants, not about the two messages:
 * the restored project is load-case-equivalent, every payload the worker would receive is
 * structured-cloneable, and the restored model solves to the same numbers.

/**
 * The snapshot as the restore path actually receives it: every object and array wrapped in a

 *
 * Two production callers hold a parsed project in `$state` before handing it to `restore()` —
 * the autosave banner and the tab manager — and Svelte hands a DEEP PROXY back out. A proxy is
 * an exotic object, which is precisely what structured clone refuses.
 *
 * A plain `$state` holder cannot stand in for that here: compiled for the server, which is how
 * Vitest builds these modules, `$state` is the identity function and proxies nothing. So the
 * condition is reproduced directly. That is not a weaker test — the defect was never about
 * Svelte specifically, it was about `restore()` adopting nested objects it does not own.

/**
 * Constraint migration, one stored shape at a time.
 *
 * ── Why these four cases and not a round trip ──────────────────────
 *
 * The round trip above proves the flagship project survives, and it would keep passing if the
 * migration were right for the one shape that project happens to store. `dofs` has four
 * distinct stored shapes and they do NOT mean the same thing to the solver:
 *
 *   absent      → the field is missing, `#[serde(default)]` supplies an empty Vec
 *   []          → present and empty, which the Rust doc-comment defines as "all translational"
 *   undefined   → present and UNIT, which serde rejects outright: "expected a sequence"
 *   ['ux','uz'] → the pre-rename spelling, which must become [0, 2]
 *
 * The third is the defect this file was opened for, and the difference between it and the
 * first is invisible in a JSON dump — `JSON.stringify` drops both. It is only visible in what
 * `Object.keys` returns, which is exactly what serde-wasm-bindgen walks.
 *
 * Driven through `restore()` rather than by importing the migration: the migration is private
 * to the store, and the property that matters is what the MODEL ends up holding.

// PR[12] review fix — cross-language parity for the biaxial section-stress
// convention. The formula lives in TWO hand-maintained implementations
// (engine/src/postprocess/section_stress_3d.rs and section-stress-3d.ts); before
// this fixture each was guarded only by its own separately-authored expected
// values, so a one-sided sign/axis-pairing flip could pass both. This test and
// the Rust test (engine/tests/.../stress_3d.rs::validation_stress_3d_parity_fixture)
// assert the SAME fixture, so the two engines cannot silently drift.

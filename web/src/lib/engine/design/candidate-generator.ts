/**
 * Candidate-generator contract.
 *
 * The generator is FEEDBACK-DRIVEN rather than a plain iterable: the search hands
 * back the authoritative verdict for each candidate, and the generator escalates
 * only the knobs that actually failed. That is what keeps the search bounded
 * (coordinate descent over independent regions) while still covering the
 * code-permitted envelope before any SECTION_INADEQUATE claim is made.
 *
 * Determinism contract: the same context + the same feedback sequence must produce
 * the same candidate sequence. Feedback is itself deterministic (it comes from the
 * pure verifier), so a whole run is reproducible. Pinned by a determinism test.

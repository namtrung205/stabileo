/**
 * The invariant the fingerprint alone can no longer carry.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `rc-baseline-digest.test.ts` was written to catch one thing: PR21 changing a concrete result.
 * It did its job for the whole branch and then, on 2026-08-15, it went red for a reason that was
 * not PR21's — main had moved 113 commits and reclassified 22 refusals from `SEARCH_EXHAUSTED`
 * to `PROVISIONAL_BIAXIAL`. The fingerprint was re-recorded under authorisation, with the
 * measurement that proved whose drift it was.
 *
 * That re-recording costs something, and this file is the payment. A fingerprint that has been
 * re-recorded once can be re-recorded again, and the next time the argument "it was main" will
 * be easier to make and harder to check. So the invariant is restated here in a form that does
 * NOT move when main moves: **this branch's metallic work is not in the concrete design path at
 * all.**
 *
 * A digest asks "did the numbers change". This asks "could they have". The two fail on different
 * days, which is the point of having both.
 *
 * ── Read as source, deliberately ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These are structural claims about which modules exist and what they import, and the honest way
 * to check that is to read the files. A runtime assertion would only prove the code did not
 * happen to execute on one fixture.

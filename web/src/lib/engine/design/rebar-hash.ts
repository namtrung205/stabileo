/**
 * Stable canonical hash of a ProvidedReinforcement.
 *
 * Used as the memo-cache key for provided-rebar verification and as the identity a
 * design certificate is bound to: when the hash changes the certificate is void.
 *
 * Requirements it must satisfy (pinned by tests):
 *   - key-order invariant  (object literal order must not change the hash)
 *   - float-noise invariant (0.15 vs 0.1500000000000002 hash the same)
 *   - any real change to counts / diameters / spacing / continuity changes the hash
 *
 * Pure: no store access, no side effects.

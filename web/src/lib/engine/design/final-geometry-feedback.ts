/**
 * Design-side feedback from the geometry detailing actually built.
 *
 * ── The gap this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Design sizes a member against its NOMINAL geometry. Coordination then moves the steel —
 * a joint-layer rank costs lever arm — and Table 26.6.2.1(a) charges an unfavourable
 * tolerance on `d` whether anything moved or not. Re-verification at that final geometry
 * is authoritative, and until now a failure there was terminal: the thirteen-condition gate
 * reported `allMembersReverified` short and there was nothing the run could do about it.
 *
 * On `rc-design-qa-8` that was beams 7 and 8 at ratio 1,031. The governing check is NOT
 * flexure — it is Table 9.7.6.2.2's maximum stirrup spacing:
 *
 *   nominal   d = 512 mm → s,max = d/2 = 256 mm, provided 250 mm  (legal, 2,4 % margin)
 *   final     d = 485 mm → s,max = d/2 = 242 mm, provided 250 mm  (3,1 % over)
 *
 * The 27 mm is the 12 mm layer raise plus the 15 mm prescribed tolerance. The design search
 * had placed the stirrups AT the nominal limit, because wider spacing is less steel and
 * nothing told it the limit was about to move. Deepening the section does not help and was
 * measured making it worse, which is the same mechanism seen from the other side: a deeper
 * member gets a larger s,max and the search spends it, arriving at the identical zero
 * margin one grid step wider.
 *
 * So the repair is to re-enumerate candidates with the final geometry KNOWN, which is what
 * this module does. It is reinforcement-only: no section changes, no re-analysis, and by
 * construction zero structural solves — the demands are inputs and are never recomputed.
 *
 * Pure: no store access, no side effects, no clock.

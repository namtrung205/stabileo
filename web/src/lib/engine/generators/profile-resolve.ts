/**
 * A catalogue profile, in the shape the built-up composer needs.
 *
 * ── The one number the catalogue does not publish ──────────────────
 *
 * `composeBuiltUp` places copies of a profile relative to each other, and every placement
 * is measured from the profile's CENTROID. For a channel or an angle the centroid is
 * nowhere near the middle of the bounding box — a UPN 80 sits 14.5 mm from the back of its
 * web and 30.5 mm from the flange tips — and the catalogue publishes neither figure.
 *
 * The canonical geometry engine does. `resolveCanonicalSection` returns `yc`, `zc` and the
 * bounding box in one frame, and the difference between them is exactly the extent this
 * module needs. So the resolution goes through canonical geometry, and the catalogue's own
 * A and I are used only to cross-check it.
 *
 * ── When the centroid is NOT known ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One family in the catalogue is properties-only: MC, whose published flange slope
 * contradicts its published properties, so no outline can be fitted (see `iram-mc.ts`).
 * For a DOUBLY SYMMETRIC family that would not matter — the centroid is the middle of the
 * box by symmetry — but MC is a channel, and putting two of them back to back on the
 * assumption that their centroids are centred would place them wrong and quietly return a
 * weak-axis inertia that is too small.
 *
 * So `centroidKnown` is reported, `canCompose` refuses the arrangements that depend on it,
 * and the caller shows the reason instead of a number. That is a real refusal today, for a
 * real family, which is what keeps it from rotting.
 *
 * Pure of stores and runes. Reads the catalogue and, through it, the WASM geometry engine.

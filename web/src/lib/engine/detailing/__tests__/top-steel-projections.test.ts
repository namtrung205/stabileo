/**
 * An assembly bar says it is one on EVERY projection, or the distinction is worth nothing.
 *
 * ── What is being distinguished ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `2Ø10` at the top of a beam looks the same whether a negative moment sized it or a stirrup
 * bend did. One of those has a verified capacity behind it and the other has nothing but
 * §25.7.1.2 — the regulation asks for a bar in the bend and says nothing about its size, so the
 * diameter is this app's choice. A reader who cannot tell them apart on the sheet they are
 * holding has been handed a number to trust that nobody checked.
 *
 * Which is why this is one file over one run rather than an assertion in each renderer. The
 * 3-D scene, the sheets, the schedule and the report are four independent readers of one
 * document, and the defect this catches is three of them saying "assembly steel" while the
 * fourth — the one that gets printed — says nothing.
 *
 * Modelled on `provisional-projections.test.ts`, which does the same job for the other
 * distinction a beam's steel can carry. A member can be both, either or neither, and the two
 * files deliberately do not know about each other.

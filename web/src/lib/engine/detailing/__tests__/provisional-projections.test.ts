/**
 * A proposal says it is a proposal on EVERY projection, or it is not honest anywhere.
 *
 * ── Why one file rather than an assertion in each ──────────────────
 *
 * The 3-D view, the drawing sheets, the bar schedule and the report are four independent
 * renderers over one document. Each of them was given the provisional marking separately, and
 * that is precisely the shape of defect this file exists to catch: three of them saying "not
 * for construction" and the fourth — the one somebody prints and hands to a site — saying
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * So the test is not "the drawing has a note". It is: for the SAME model, in the SAME run,
 * every output that shows a provisional member's steel also carries the warning, and no
 * output shows a proposal where a verified design would look identical.
 *
 * ── What must never pass ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A proposal acquiring a certificate. A provisional member counted as MODELLED. A sheet or a
 * schedule that draws provisional steel with no warning on it. A CONSTRUCTIBLE verdict on an
 * assembly that carries one. Each has its own assertion below, and each of them would have
 * been true at some point during the change that added this state.

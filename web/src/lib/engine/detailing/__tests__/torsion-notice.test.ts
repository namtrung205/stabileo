/**
 * Unevaluated torsion says so on EVERY projection, and changes nothing else.
 *
 * ── The two halves of this file ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first half is the rule itself, on literals: which members it names, which it does not,
 * and what happens the day an adapter gains the check.
 *
 * The second half is the same shape as `provisional-projections.test.ts`, and for the same
 * reason. The 3-D view, the sheets, the schedule and the report are four independent renderers
 * over one document, each given this warning separately — which is exactly the defect worth
 * guarding: three of them warning and the fourth, the one somebody prints and hands to a site,
 * saying nothing.
 *
 * ── What must never pass ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A member disappearing from the scene because its torsion was not checked. A member turning
 * into a refusal. A proposal losing its proposal. A certificate changing. Each of those would
 * be the application making the engineer's decision for them by hiding the evidence, and each
 * has its own assertion below.

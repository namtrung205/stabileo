/**
 * Why 5 of the 119 beams in the flagship building carry a PROPOSAL and not a design.
 *
 * ── The question this file answers ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Running the whole chain on `Edificio H.A. 7 pisos — PRO` and opening the 3-D workspace used to
 * show every column reinforced, exactly two beams reinforced, and the rest drawn as bare orange
 * concrete. That picture had two completely different explanations and they demanded opposite
 * responses:
 *
 *   - the design legitimately refused those members, and the viewer was telling the truth; or
 *   - the design produced steel and something between the document, the projection and the
 *     screen dropped it.
 *
 * Guessing is not allowed here — one of those answers is a limitation to be reported to the
 * engineer, the other is a defect to be fixed — so this audits every beam across all four
 * places its reinforcement could exist (the design outcome, the model's own record, the
 * DocumentModel, the SceneModel) and sorts them into categories that tell the explanations
 * apart.
 *
 * ── The answer, as first measured: 117 refusals ────────────────────
 *
 * It was the first explanation: the refusals were real, not lost steel. `resolveDesignAxes`
 * measures the secondary moment against a 10 % threshold, and no verifier in this app evaluates
 * a beam's secondary axis, so a beam over that threshold cannot be called designed.
 *
 * ── Why the number is now 5, and why that is the true one ──────────
 *
 * They now carry a PROVISIONAL_BIAXIAL proposal: the ordinary bounded search run against the
 * primary axis, with the threshold untouched, the verifier untouched, and no capacity invented
 * for the axis nobody checks.
 *
 * ── How many, and why that number moved ────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file first recorded 117 provisional beams against 2 verified. That count was measured
 * against this fixture's DECLARED section inertias, and for its beams they are transposed:
 *
 *     VP 30×80   declared iy = 0.0018   iz = 0.0128     b·h³/12 = 0.0128
 *     VS 30×65   declared iy = 0.001463 iz = 0.006866   b·h³/12 = 0.006866
 *
 * The engine's convention puts the strong-axis inertia in `iy` (`rectangle(b, h)` lays h along
 * section-z, and `iy = ∫z²dA`, so iy = b·h³/12), and `iy` is what drives gravity bending on a
 * horizontal member. So every beam was solved 7.11× (VP) / 4.69× (VS) too FLEXIBLE about the
 * axis it actually bends on, and the same factor too STIFF laterally. The secondary moments
 * that pushed 117 beams over the 10 % threshold were an artefact of that swap, not of the
 * building. The columns are square (iy = iz), which is why only the beams moved.
 *
 * What corrected it is the canonical-section work that arrived with the merge from main:
 * `web/src/lib/section/` derives a rectangle's inertias from its own geometry and the solver
 * prefers them over the declared pair (`solver-service.ts`, `props.source === 'canonical'`).
 * The declared values are simply no longer consulted for a geometry-backed section.
 *
 * NOTE the fixture itself is still wrong — nothing here fixed `pro-edificio-7p.json`, and a
 * model whose sections do not resolve to canonical geometry would still be solved from the
 * transposed pair. That is worth a separate look.
 *
 * With the correct axis the picture inverts, and it is the better one — 114 beams now receive a
 * real design instead of a proposal:
 *
 *   114  verified, detailed, and present in the scene
 *     5  provisional proposals, with bars in the model, the document and the scene
 *     0  verified but with lost geometry
 *     0  verified but never detailed
 *     0  detailed but filtered out of the scene
 *     0  beams drawn with no steel at all
 *     0  workflow errors
 *
 * The five that remain are genuinely biaxial rather than threshold noise: their secondary
 * ratios are 0.106, 0.122, 0.168, 0.172 and 0.244, all clear of the 0.10 threshold. None of
 * them now exceeds 1.0 — with the axis corrected, no beam in this building bends harder about
 * its secondary axis than its primary one, which the earlier measurement claimed some did.
 *
 * The threshold itself is deliberately NOT touched here, and neither is the verifier, and no
 * provisional member is ever counted as verified — the assertions below check all three.
 * `docs/audits/biaxial-beam-design.md` is the evidence for why real biaxial design was not
 * attempted in this pass, and it remains the plan for the five that still need it.
 *
 * These assertions are written to fail LOUDLY if the shape of the answer ever changes —
 * including if it improves. A drop in the provisional count means either the biaxial path
 * started covering beams or the demands feeding it moved, and both are deliberate acts that
 * should update this file, not silent ones. That is exactly how the 117 above was caught.

/**
 * Public URLs carry their language in the path: `/es/blog/x`, `/en`, `/pt`.
 *
 * ── Why, since the app detects the language perfectly well on its own ──
 *
 * Because a search engine stores ONE version of a URL. Googlebot crawls with a
 * single locale, so `stabileo.com/` was indexed in English and the Spanish and
 * Portuguese pages existed at no address anything could store — for a product
 * whose market searches in Spanish and whose differentiator is an Argentine
 * code. There is no header- or script-based way around it: `hreflang`, the
 * mechanism Google defines for multilingual sites, points at URLs, so the
 * languages need URLs to point at.
 *
 * ── The shape ──
 *
 *   /                      x-default. English content, plus a script that
 *                          sends a Spanish or Portuguese browser onward.
 *   /es  /en  /pt          the landing, per language
 *   /es/blog               the index
 *   /es/blog/<slug>        a post — the slug does NOT translate, so the same
 *                          post is one link in three languages, differing only
 *                          in the prefix
 *
 * No language is privileged: `/es/` is not shorter than `/pt/`. The root is a
 * doorway rather than a home, which is what lets the three be equals.
 *
 * The editor is deliberately NOT in here. `/app/basic`, `/demo` and shared
 * model links keep the URLs they have always had: they are not content, nobody
 * should reach them from a search, and changing them would break links people
 * already hold.

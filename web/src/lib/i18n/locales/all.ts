/**
 * Every dictionary on disk, including the ones the application does not offer.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists, and why nothing in `src/` may import it ──
 *
 * `store.ts` used to import all fourteen locales so that re-enabling
 * one would be a single edit. The cost of that convenience was not visible
 * until the landing and the blog were measured: the eleven locales the app
 * refuses to switch to were **2.0 MB of the 14.6 MB bundle** — the single
 * largest item in it, ahead of the solver and ahead of Three.js — and every
 * reader of a blog post downloaded all of them to read a page that exists in
 * three languages.
 *
 * They are unreachable at runtime, not merely unused: `setLocale` refuses a
 * code that is not offered, `detectBrowserLocale` only ever returns an offered
 * one, and no production caller passes a locale to `tAt`. Nothing but tests
 * ever read them.
 *
 * So the store now imports the three the app speaks, and the other eleven live
 * here. The translation work is kept — that was the point of holding on to
 * them — and the parity gates still read every one, because they import this
 * file. What changed is that a browser no longer does.
 *
 * Re-enabling a locale is still a single edit, just in the other direction:
 * add it to `dicts` in store.ts and to OFFERED_LOCALES.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: importing this from application code silently puts all fourteen
 * back into the bundle. `no-all-locales-in-app.test.ts` fails if anything
 * under `src/` outside `__tests__` does.

/**
 * Every dictionary that exists, offered or not. Gates only.
 *
 * The steel spread mirrors `dicts` in store.ts, and it has to.
 *
 * The point of this module is that a gate reading it sees what the application
 * ships. #135 folded `locales/steel/*` into es/en/pt without touching `es.ts`
 * — those files hold zero `steel.*` keys — so listing the base dictionaries
 * alone would hand every gate that walks this file a view of the three offered
 * locales with an entire PRO namespace missing from it.
 *
 * Nothing reads a `steel.*` key through here today, so the divergence would
 * not have shown up as a failure. It would have shown up as a gate quietly
 * covering less than it claims, which is the failure mode this file was split
 * out to avoid rather than to introduce.

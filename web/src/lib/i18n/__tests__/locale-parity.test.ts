/**
 * Key-parity guard for the locale dictionaries.
 *
 * `t()` (see ../store.ts) falls back to `dicts.en` whenever the active
 * locale's dict is missing a key. That fallback is silent — a locale can be
 * missing an entire feature's worth of keys and nothing will error, it will
 * just quietly render English to speakers of that locale. This has already
 * happened twice (see PR78's `design.*` gap, where en/es got ~190 new keys
 * and the other 12 locales got none). This test exists so it can't happen a
 * third time without a test failure calling it out.
 *
 * Scope: `design.*` keys only, for now.
 *
 * A full `Object.keys(en).every(...)` parity check was attempted while writing
 * this test and turned up ~790 pre-existing missing keys (mostly `landing.*`
 * marketing copy) in EVERY non-en/es locale, plus 31 pre-existing missing
 * `landing.*` keys in es — drift that long predates this PR and is unrelated
 * to the RC design surface. Asserting full parity today would fail on that
 * inherited debt rather than on anything this change touched, so the check
 * below is deliberately scoped to the `design.*` namespace, which this PR
 * fully repaired (0 missing / 0 extra across all 14 dicts).
 *
 * TODO: widen this to full key parity across every namespace once the
 * pre-existing `landing.*` (and other) translation debt is paid down. Until
 * then, that debt is tracked by the `it.todo` below rather than silently
 * un-tested.

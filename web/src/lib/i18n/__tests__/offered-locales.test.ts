/**
 * Three languages, offered honestly — and the rules that keep the offer true.
 *
 * The picker listed fourteen. Eleven of those dictionaries are largely English underneath, so a
 * German browser auto-detected into a German label over an English UI, which reads as broken
 * rather than as untranslated. PR20 narrowed the offer to English, Español and Português and made
 * detection, persistence and the picker agree about that list.
 *
 * Every case below is one the app can actually be in, and each is asserted through the module's
 * own entry points rather than by inspecting a variable:
 *
 *   - the list itself, because the picker renders it and the tests below all depend on it;
 *   - detection for each offered language, including regional variants (`es-AR`, `pt-BR`);
 *   - detection for a language that is NOT offered, which must land on English;
 *   - a manual choice, persisted and honoured across a reload;
 *   - a stored choice that is no longer offered, which must NOT be honoured;
 *   - a hot switch, which must not need a reload.
 *
 * ── Why every case re-imports the module ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `_locale` is initialised at module scope, from `navigator` and `localStorage`, exactly once —
 * which is the behaviour under test. A test that imported once and then changed `navigator` would
 * be asserting about a decision the module had already made. `vi.resetModules()` plus a dynamic
 * import is what makes "open the app in a Portuguese browser" a thing this file can say.

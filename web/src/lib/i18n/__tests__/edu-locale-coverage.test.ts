/**
 * Education renders in English, Spanish and Portuguese with nothing missing.

 * `t()` falls back to English for an absent key, silently. That is the right
 * behaviour for a half-translated locale — better English than a raw key — but
 * it means a mode can lose half its translation and look fine to whoever is
 * reading it in English. Portuguese was in exactly that state: 196 of the 388
 * keys Education renders were absent, so a Brazilian teacher writing an
 * exercise met an English form.
 *
 * The three languages this test names are the ones the product commits to.
 * The other locales are deliberately NOT checked: they sit around 57% overall
 * and their gap is a separate piece of work, not something to fail this gate.

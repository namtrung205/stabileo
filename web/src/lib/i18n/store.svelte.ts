/**
 * The dictionaries the application actually speaks.
 *
 * ── Why only three ──
 *
 * This used to hold all fourteen on disk, so that re-enabling one was a single
 * edit. Measured on the bundle, the eleven the app refuses to switch to came
 * to 2.0 MB — the largest single item in it, ahead of the solver and ahead of
 * Three.js — shipped to every reader of a blog page written in three
 * languages. They were unreachable, not just unused: setLocale rejects an
 * unoffered code, detectBrowserLocale only returns offered ones, and no
 * production caller passes a locale to tAt.
 *
 * The other eleven now live in ./locales/all.ts, which only the gates import,
 * so the translation work is still kept and still checked. Re-enabling one is
 * still a single edit: add it here and to OFFERED_LOCALES.
 *
 * ── Why the steel spread stays ──
 *
 * `steel/*` arrived from #135 while this branch was open, and the two changes
 * rewrote the same object. The merge keeps BOTH halves, and the reason is
 * worth recording because "take the shorter one" is the obvious mistake here:
 * the metallic keys exist ONLY in `locales/steel/*` — `es.ts` has zero of
 * them — so dropping the spread does not fall back to English, it renders the
 * raw key. `pro-flow-coverage.test.ts` would catch it, but by then it reads as
 * a puzzling red rather than as this decision.
 *
 * Folding steel into es/en/pt and nothing else is #135's rule, unchanged: they
 * are the offered three, and a PRO surface must speak all of them.

// step — it fails if a locale here is missing copy, quotes different figures,
// names a different standard, or reads as a truncation of the English.
//
// NOTE (2026-08-19): this list is now identical to `OFFERED_LOCALES` above,
// which arrived from main when the application itself narrowed to three
// languages. They are not merged here on purpose: they answer different
// questions — one gates marketing copy, the other gates the whole UI — and
// collapsing them is the i18n workstream's call, not a side effect of a
// landing change. If they are ever meant to be one thing, this is the comment
